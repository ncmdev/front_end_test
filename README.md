Frontend Codetest. 
=================

The essential goal is to create a "movie queue" app using ember.js and handlebars. Those are the only required technologies. There are some specific requirements  specified below, but we encourage you to create the app however you like. Whether you want to server side technologies (like rails or node.js), or a fully complete single page js app is completely up to you. We want to see your style and your creativity. Definitely use as many (or as little) libraries, plugins, or frameworks as you want. It's important to demonstrate how you like to code. Code style, attention to detail, and mastery of the frameworks are what we want to see. Our environment is very colaborative, everyone touches and sees everyone else's code, we would love to see code that we want to work with! 

The app should roughly follow this wireframe: https://gwi.hotgloo.com/wf/ad5f59d6#/65ca2f20

You do not need to strictly adhere to the layout of the wire; it is a guide, and the exact specifics of the pixels should not get in your way. 

Specs:

* When the user searches for a title, the system will use themoviedb.com api (or some other freely availabile source) to find a movie poster. 
* If no poster can be found, then only the text title of the movie is necessary. 
* A user can delete movies from his or her queue. 
* You should use the full MVC architecture of ember.js. There should at least be a user and a movie model. 

Required Technologies:
* http://emberjs.com (v1.1.2)
* http://handlebarsjs.com/ 
* https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/v1.1.2.zip (The "ember js" starter kit. You do not need to use this, but it is a handy starting point.)

It is only required that the app come fully packaged (with all depencies either managed with a tool like Bundler, or documented in a readme), and fully functional as specified. The test should be submitted as a github repo, public or private is fine. (If you have issues with this, please reachout via email, and we can arrange a different submission process). 

You'll need to create an API key for themoviedb.com (or whatever other source you use). If you have difficulty or issues with this, please reachout via email. 

The following are not required, but would definitely help set you apart from your competition:

* Make it responsive/adaptive to different screen sizes (smart phone, tablet, desktop). 
* Create integration or unit tests (we recomend you use QUnit and the Ember test helpers, but do whatever you feel is best). 
* Make your code "self documenting" and/or rich comments where necessary. 
* Make it look nice. This isn't a designer position, so we niether expect nor want you to get creative with the visual appeal, but feel free to use any html/css frameworks or themes to give it a polished look. It would be great if you can demonstrate an attention to detail. 

Have fun with this, it's an opporutnity to start off the dialogue as we begin the interview process. Reachout if you have any questions or comments. Otherwise we can't wait to meet you!
