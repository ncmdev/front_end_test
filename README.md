Frontend Codetest. 
=================

The essential goal is to create a "movie queue" app using ember.js and handlebars. Those are the only required technologies. There are some specific requirements specified below, but we encourage you to create the app however you like. Whether you want to use server side technologies (like rails or node.js), or have a fully complete single page js app is completely up to you. We want to see your style and your creativity. Definitely use as many (or as few) libraries, plugins, or frameworks as you want. It's important to demonstrate how you like to code. Code style, attention to detail, and mastery of the frameworks are what we want to see. Our environment is very collaborative, everyone touches and sees everyone else's code, we would love to see code that we want to work with! 

The app should roughly follow this wireframe: https://github.com/plexusent/front_end_test/blob/master/codetest_wire.png

You do not need to strictly adhere to the layout of the wireframe; it is a guide, and the exact pixel-specifics should not get in your way. 

Specs:

* When the user searches for a title, the system will use gowatchit.com API and return a list of results that are displayed. 
* Each result has a button to add to queue
* If no poster can be found, then only the text title of the movie is necessary. 
* There's a queue page that shows all movies that have a been added to the queue
* A user can delete movies from his or her queue. 

It is only required that the app come fully packaged (with all depencies either managed with a tool like Bundler, or documented in a readme), and fully functional as specified. The test should be submitted as a github repo, public or private is fine. (If you have issues with this, please reach out via email, and we can arrange a different submission process). 

The following are not required, but would definitely help set you apart:

* Make it responsive/adaptive to different screen sizes (smart phone, tablet, desktop). 
* Create integration or unit tests (we recomend using QUnit and the Ember test helpers, but do whatever you feel is best). 
* Make your code "self documenting" and/or rich comments where necessary. 
* Make it look nice. This isn't a designer position, so we don't expect you to get creative with the visual appeal, but feel free to use any html/css frameworks or themes to give it a polished look. It would be great if you can demonstrate an attention to detail. 

Have fun with this. Reach out if you have any questions or comments. Good luck!
